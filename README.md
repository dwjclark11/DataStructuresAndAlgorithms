# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
This is a group of data structures from the Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in C and C++ course that I am currently taking. I will be updating this daily and adding new structures as I complete them in the course. I am also changing the structures based on need.  This course was to help increase my understanding of data structures and to become a better overall programmer.

## Data Structures Completed:
### C Style
*    Singly Linked List
*    Doubly Linked List
*    Stack using array
*    Stack using Linked List
*    Queue using array
*    Binary Tree Implementation
*    Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

### C++ Style
*    Vector template class (ADT) Dynamic Array
*    Singly Linked List
*    Doubly Linked List
*    Polynomial Representation using Linked List
*    Sparse Matrix Representation using Linked List
*    Stack Template using linked list
*    Some Utiliy functions using stack
     * Convert from infix to postfix - Simple
     * Convert from infix to postfix - more advanced
*    Queue Template using array
*    Queue Template using Linked List
*    Queue Template using 2 Stacks

I will continue to add more as I go through the course
